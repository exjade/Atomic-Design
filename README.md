**Atomic Design**

I am learning **the Atomic Design Methodology** created by Brad Frost. 
 
Frost proposes to design based on components, that is, small and modular elements that together allow us to create more complex pages or sections of our project.

The hierarchy of these elements is based on the fundamental concepts of chemistry:

- Atoms
- Molecules
- Organisms

Two more components are also included: 
> *Wich complement the system and help us to build more complex structures.*
- Templates
- Pages
